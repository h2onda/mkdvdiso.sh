mkdvdiso.sh is script which is to create bootable DVD iso of a Red Hat Linux Distribution. Original version's author is Chris Kloiber <ckloiber@redhat.com>. 

I'll change the script to add few functions.

 - Support recent distributions (Find implantisomd5 path)
 - To create Source DVD (non-bootable)
 - check iso md5sum
