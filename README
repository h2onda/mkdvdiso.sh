mkdvdiso.sh is script which is to create bootable DVD iso of a Red Hat Linux Distribution. That can download from http://mirror.centos.org/centos/build/mkdvdiso.sh .
Original version's author is Chris Kloiber <ckloiber@redhat.com>,  

I'll change the script to add few functions.

 - Support recent distributions (Find implantisomd5 path)
 - To create Source DVD (non-bootable)
 - check iso md5sum
